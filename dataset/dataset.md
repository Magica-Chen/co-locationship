# Data sets

## BrightKite

This datset is a LBSN service provider that allowed registered users to connect with their existing social ties and also meet new people based on the places that they go. Once a user "checked in" at a place, they could post notes and photos to a location and other users could comment on those posts. 
The social relationship network was collected using their public API, and consists of 58,228 nodes and 214,078 edges. 
The network is originally directed but it has constructed a network with undirected edges when there is a social relationship in both ways. 
The dataaset consists a total of 4,491,143 checkins of these users over the period of Apr 2008 - Oct 2010.

## Gowalla

This dataset is a LBSN website where users share their locations by checking-in. 
In early versions of the service, users would occasionally receive a virtual "Item" as a bonus upon checking in, and these items could be swapped or dropped at other spots. 
Users became "Founders" of a spot by dropping an item there. 
This incentives users to create new check-ins, not necessarily to check-in consistently at frequently visited locations.  
The social relationship network is undirected and was collected using their public API, and consists of 196,591 nodes and 950,327 edges. 
Totally, it has 6,442,890 check-ins of these users over the period of Feb. 2009 - Oct. 2010.

## Weeplace

This dataset is collected from Weeplaces and integrated with the APIs of other LBSN services, e.g., Facebook Places, Foursquare, and Gowalla. 
Users can login Weeplaces using their LBSN accounts and connect with their social ties in the same LBSN who have also used this application. 
Weeplaces visualizes your check-ins on a map. 
Unlike Gowalla, there is no direct incentive in Weeplaces to alter one's visitation habits or check-ins, so there should be a more accurate representation of a regular person's mobility patterns. 
All the crawled data is originally generated in Foursquare. 
This dataset contains 7,658,368 check-ins generated by 15,799 users over 971,309 locations in approximately 50,000 cities worldwide from Nov 2003 to Jun 2011.
